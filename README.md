My name is Heidi Pierce. I am learning to be a web designer through codecademy. I have taken courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Command Line and Python. I have a Master's in Counseling Psychology and used to work in children's and adult mental health until I had to take a leave of absence after developing Narcolepsy.
